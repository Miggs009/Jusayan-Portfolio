          <p>Our Fairies are happy to assist with light household chores such as cleaning, cooking, and laundry,
            provided it does not interfere with their childcare duties. For cooking, they can handle basic tasks like
            frying and reheating food. However, please understand that they may not be able to replicate specific dishes
            to perfection, as individual tastes vary. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In terms of cleaning, they can sweep, mop, and tidy up rooms and
            messes left by their charges. They can also freshen up bathrooms after use. However, it's important to
            manage expectations regarding the level of detail in cleaning, as they may not achieve the same standards as
            professional cleaning companies.

          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
            At this time, our Fairies are not trained to provide care for pets. We

        <p>We understand your concerns and take several measures to ensure that our fairies are reliable and capable
          caregivers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>• All fairies undergo an initial interview to assess their qualifications. We prioritize candidates with
            at least 3 years of experience as a nanny/yaya and those who are former OFWs, as they typically demonstrate
            a higher level of professionalism and expertise.</li>
          <li>• Candidates who pass the initial interview proceed to undergo psychological assessments. This helps us
            ensure that they possess the necessary competence, mental and emotional stability, and capacity to handle
            the demands of the job with grace under pressure.</li>
          <li>• Only candidates who successfully complete the first two steps proceed to training, during which a
            background check is conducted to verify their credentials and qualifications.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Once all requirements have been met and verified, fairies are ready to begin their duties with confidence and
          proficiency, providing your family with the exceptional care and support they deserve.
          We maintain open communication with both our fairies and clients to address any concerns or issues that may
          arise. Our dedicated support team is available to assist you at any time, providing peace of mind knowing that
          your children are in safe hands.
          By implementing these measures, we strive to guarantee the safety and reliability of our fairies, allowing you
          to trust us with the care of your precious children. At My Fairee, we prioritize the safety and well-being of
          your children above all else.</p>

      <p>Yes, we offer subscription plans designed to provide clients with greater flexibility and convenience. These
        membership-based plans allow you to secure your preferred fairies for your scheduled needs. With our recurring
        Subscription Plan, you'll enjoy subsequent discounts on your total amount, depending on the number of days you
        require a fairy in a month. The rates for our subscription plans are highly customizable and are based on your
        specific needs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For example, if you require a fairy three times a week for four hours each time, we would calculate the total
        for 12 sessions (multiplied by four weeks). This total would then receive a discount ranging from 2.5% to 5%.
        Additionally, if you choose to prepay for the entire month, an extra 2.5% to 5% discount will be applied.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our subscription plans offer great flexibility, allowing you to tailor your schedule to suit your family's
        needs. Here are a few examples of how customizable our plans can be:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>• You can schedule eight hours on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, four hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays,
          and twelve hours on Saturdays.</li>
        <li>• Alternatively, you can opt for a heavier schedule every other week, with two sessions per week for four
          hours in the first and third weeks, and three sessions per week for twelve hours in the second and fourth
          weeks.</li>
        <li>• You can also keep it simple by blocking off twelve sessions for the month and providing us with your
          schedule for the upcoming week every Friday.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>The main advantage of our Subscription Plan is the ability to reserve fairies for the days you need them. With
        advanced scheduling, we can better accommodate your requests and ensure that your preferred fairies are
        available to meet your needs. On-demand bookings, on the other hand, are subject to availability.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>• Hygiene:</strong> Fairies are required to be clean before their shift. Clients are requested to
            provide bathroom access for their showering or changing (depending on what you are comfortable with). Rest
            assured that Fairies bring their own toiletries and clothes.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Meals and Snacks:</strong> Fairies typically bring their own meals, snacks, and cutlery. If
            clients wish to share a meal with them, advance notice is appreciated. That way they won't bring their
            packed meals. Clients are also encouraged to allow Fairies to refill their water bottles from the client's
            water supply.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Tipping:</strong> Tipping or gift-giving is not obligatory, but clients are welcome to do so if
            they are highly satisfied with the Fairies' service. Tips and gifts go directly to the Fairies.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• No Phone Policy:</strong> Fairies are not allowed to use their phones while on duty. Clients are
            encouraged to report any violations of this policy.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Maintaining Professional Distance:</strong> Clients are requested to maintain a professional
            distance with Fairies, as they are independent contractors. In line with this, please avoid sharing your
            personal information (phone number, Facebook account details) with the Fairy and vice versa. This is to
            prevent over familiarity between Fairies and clients.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Transactions through the Office:</strong> All payments and bookings should be conducted strictly
            through the office. This is to avoid confusion and conflicts. If there are separate transactions with
            Fairies, the office cannot assist in case of concerns or issues.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Mask Policy:</strong> Requiring the use of masks throughout the duty is a good safety measure,
            with exceptions for eating or drinking. Clients are encouraged to report any violations.</li><br>
          <li><strong>• Supervised interaction:</strong> Since the Fairies are not stay-in help, we would suggest that
            all services would be supervised by yourself or a trusted family member. This is to ensure that your child
            does not get scared with an unfamiliar face.</li>
